# project-linkon

An app which allows you to securely store data online, create archives and make publically shareable links (for social media bio, resumes, storing information / notes, etc).

No extra information is needed from the user, only a unique username and a strong password. Everything else is completely decentralised as per the user's wishes.

## Technical requirements

- Shortening links which are accessible via URL route parameters
- Symmetric encryption which encrypts the user's data uniquely (little bit of hashing here and there is desirable)

## Technological stack

The app will be released in various language / framework packages, however, the main deployed app will have one common database and one common API to access the application through various clients.
